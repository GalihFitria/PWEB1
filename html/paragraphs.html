    <p>little cat named Puti</p>

    <p>
      Puti is a Himalayan cat, which is a cross between a Persian cat and a
      Siamese cat. With dense and smooth fur that tends to be long, Puti has a
      characteristic round face and flat nose which are characteristic of the
      Himalayan breed. His friendly and affectionate nature makes him a
      delightful companion for families. Puti loves to play and likes to be
      around the people she cares about. With her beauty and charming
      personality, Puti became a family member who was loved and well cared for.
